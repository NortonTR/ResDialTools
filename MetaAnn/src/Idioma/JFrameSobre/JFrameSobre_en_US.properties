textoSobre = MetaAnn is a annotators generator, that is, a tool used for the configuration and creation of annotation tools. Within MetaAnn, annotation schemes are defined as a series of categories to be applied to each unit of corpus annotation. In it, the user is able to determine the corpus to be annotated, configure the categories and the options and define dependency between them. At the end, the system generates the annotation tool as configured by the user and also provides the source code in case the researcher wants to make any changes.
